# Motivation

## ðŸ•¯Prerequisites

What kind of things does _routeshub_ solve?

* **magic strings** - that behavior takes a lot of our time and attention
* **variables** - faster and safer navigating through route's state
* **code completion** - nice to have abstraction level using enhanced routes
* **pattern** - managing routes in the agreed manner

## ðŸ•¯Plugin

Routeshub serves as a small unit that simplifies life in the short and long term.

It was designed to be added at any time during the development.

## ðŸ•¯Pattern

The package offers a few approaches to configure and manage routes as consistently and as clearly as possible which allows you to stop worrying about routes and do what is really important.

The documentation proposes the style guide which is recommended to follow.

## ðŸ•¯Looking for the best

This project is neither ideal nor final.

Just a step for the better. A step to help engineers building applications better and faster.

That's why I'll be happy with any kind of involvement and I am opened to any suggestions.

**Essence**

It is a slightly different concept from _state management._

Routeshub collects and analyzes routes information to create manageable state of route_._ You can understand this concept as a **hub**.
