# Principles

Have you ever heard of state management, but only for routes? - I don't ❓ 

Is it another state management? Essentially no ❗ 

Read the principles and benefits below to understand what is it ✅ 

## 🕯Pattern

Routeshub offers a few approaches to configure and manage routes as consistently and as clearly as possible, which allows you to stop worrying about routes and do what is really important.

## 🕯Freshness 

It is quite important to pay attention to narrow and poorly researched places. Do not underestimate it.

Routeshub serves as a small unit that simplifies life in the short and long term in the safest and predictable way.

## 🕯Consistency

There is no way to get rid of the routine in working with routes, you can only build a smoother process, and therefore calm, consistent and predictable.

Routeshub is built on the typescript that provides a level of abstraction through generics, which ultimately adds completion suggestions. Also inside is rxjs, but now it is using only to store the routes slices.

So, every time you are about to figure out what is in the slice, you will find it by code auto-completion in the editor.

## 🕯Looking for the best

This project is not an ideal and final. 

Just a step for the better. A step to help developers build applications better, faster and calmer. 

So I am open to any suggestions that help with that goal.
